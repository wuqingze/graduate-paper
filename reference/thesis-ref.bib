We review memory management, and describe the differences between “real mode” and “protected mode.” The Linux process model is described, followed by a detailed examination of the file system. We describe the Linux command shell and some of its more useful features, and finally cover man and info, two tools for getting help from Linux."

Jakobsson, T. Leighton, S. Micali, and M. Szydlo [Fractal Merkle tree representation and traversal, in: RSA Cryptographers Track, RSA Security Conference, 2003] and M. Szydlo [Merkle tree traversal in log space and time, in: Proc. Eurocrypt, in: LNCS, vol. 3027, 2004, pp. 541–554; Merkle tree traversal in log space and time, Preprint version 2003, available at http://www.szydlo.com]. In particular, we show that our algorithm requires 2logn/log(3)n hash function computations and storage for less than (logn/log(3)n+1)loglogn+2logn hash values, where n is the number of leaves in the Merkle tree. We also prove that these trade-offs are optimal, i.e. there is no algorithm that requires less than O(logn/logt) time and less than O(tlogn/logt) space for any choice of parameter t≥2. Our algorithm could be of special interest in the case when both time and space are limited."

  author = "Abdulhadi Shoufan and Nico Huber and H. Gregor Molter",
  keywords = "Chained Merkle signature scheme, Cryptography hardware and implementation, Cryptoprocessor, FPGA, Winternitz one-time signature",
  abstract = "One-time signature schemes rely on hash functions and are, therefore, assumed to be resistant to attacks by quantum computers. These approaches inherently raise a key management problem, as the key pair can be used only for one message. That means, for one-time signature schemes to work, the sender must deliver the verification key together with the message and the signature. Upon reception, the receiver has to verify the authenticity of the verification key before verifying the signature itself. Hash-tree based solutions tackle this problem by basing the authenticity of a large number of verification keys on the authenticity of a root key. This approach, however, causes computation, communication, and storage overhead. Due to hardware acceleration, this paper proposes, for the first time, a processor architecture which boosts the performance of a one-time signature scheme without degrading memory usage and communication properties. This architecture realizes the chained Merkle signature scheme on the basis of Winternitz one-time signature scheme. All operations, i.e., key generation, signing, and verification are implemented on an FPGA platform, which acts as a coprocessor. Timing measurements on the prototype show a performance boost of at least one order of magnitude compared to an identical software solution."

The effects of voltage, table rotation speed, pressure and slurry flow rate on the removal rate were investigated. The electrochemical mechanical polishing mechanism was primarily analyzed. The results show that NiP substrate can be polished with ECMP method at low pressure (3.5 kPa) and the material removal rate (MRR) can be controlled by adjusting polishing voltage, rotation speed of polishing table and slurry flow rate."
